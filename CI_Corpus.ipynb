same way human beings can.', 'NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.', 'Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.', 'NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly—even in real time.', 'There’s a good chance you’ve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences.', 'But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.', 'NLP tasks', 'Human language is filled with ambiguities that make it incredibly difficult to write software that accurately determines the intended meaning of text or voice data.', 'Homonyms, homophones, sarcasm, idioms, metaphors, grammar and usage exceptions, variations in sentence structure—these just a few of the irregularities of human language that take humans years to learn, but that programmers must teach natural language-driven applications to recognize and understand accurately from the start, if those applications are going to be useful.', \"Several NLP tasks break down human text and voice data in ways that help the computer make sense of what it's ingesting.\", 'Some of these tasks include the following:', 'Speech recognition, also called speech-to-text, is the task of reliably converting voice data into text data.', 'Speech recognition is required for any application that follows voice commands or answers spoken questions.', 'What makes speech recognition especially challenging is the way people talk—quickly, slurring words together, with varying emphasis and intonation, in different accents, and often using incorrect grammar.', 'Part of speech tagging, also called grammatical tagging, is the process of determining the part of speech of a particular word or piece of text based on its use and context.', 'Part of speech identifies ‘make’ as a verb in ‘I can make a paper plane,’ and as a noun in ‘What make of car do you own?’', 'Word sense disambiguation is the selection of the meaning of a word with multiple meanings\\xa0 through a process of semantic analysis that determine the word that makes the most sense in the given context.', \"For example, word sense disambiguation helps distinguish the meaning of the verb\\xa0'make' in ‘make the grade’ (achieve) vs. ‘make a bet’ (place).\", 'Named entity recognition,\\xa0or NEM, identifies words or phrases as useful entities.', \"NEM identifies ‘Kentucky’ as a location or ‘Fred’ as a man's name.\", 'Co-reference resolution is the task of identifying if and when two words refer to the same entity.', \"The most common example is determining the person or object to which a certain pronoun refers (e.g., ‘she’ = ‘Mary’), \\xa0but it can also involve identifying a metaphor or an idiom in the text \\xa0(e.g., an instance in which 'bear' isn't an animal but a large hairy person).\", 'Sentiment analysis\\xa0attempts to extract subjective qualities—attitudes, emotions, sarcasm, confusion, suspicion—from text.', \"Natural language generation\\xa0is sometimes described as the opposite of speech recognition or speech-to-text; it's the task of putting structured information into human language.\", 'See the blog post “NLP vs. NLU vs. NLG: the differences between three natural language processing concepts” for a deeper look into how

NLTK includes libraries for many of the NLP tasks listed above, plus libraries for subtasks, such as sentence parsing, word segmentation, stemming and lemmatization (methods of trimming words down to their roots), and tokenization (for breaking phrases, sentences, paragraphs and passages into tokens that help the computer better understand the text).', 'It also includes libraries for implementing capabilities such as semantic reasoning, the ability to reach logical conclusions based on facts extracted from text.', 'Statistical NLP, machine learning, and deep learning', \"The earliest NLP applications were hand-coded, rules-based systems that could perform certain NLP tasks, but couldn't easily scale to accommodate a seemingly endless stream of exceptions or the increasing volumes of text and voice data.\", 'Enter statistical NLP, which combines computer algorithms with machine learning and deep learning models to automatically extract, classify, and label elements of text and voice data and then assign a statistical likelihood to each possible meaning of those elements.', \"Today, deep learning models and learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) enable NLP systems that 'learn' as they work and extract ever more accurate meaning from huge volumes of raw, unstructured, and unlabeled text and voice data sets.\", 'For a deeper dive into the nuances between these technologies and their learning approaches, see “AI vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning vs. Neural Networks: What’s the Difference?”',

handful of NLP problems that experts consider 'mostly solved' (although you may argue that this doesn’t match your email experience).\", 'Machine translation:\\xa0Google Translate is an example of widely available NLP technology at work.', 'Truly useful machine translation involves more than replacing words in one language with words of another. \\xa0', 'Effective translation has to capture accurately the meaning and tone of the input language and translate it to text with the same meaning and desired impact in the output language.', 'Machine translation tools are making good progress in terms of accuracy.', 'A great way to test any machine translation tool is to translate text to one language and then back to the original.', 'An oft-cited classic example: Not long ago, translating “The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak” from English to Russian and back yielded “The vodka is good but the meat is rotten.”', 'Today, the result is “The spirit desires, but the flesh is weak,”

recognition to recognize patterns in voice commands and natural language generation to respond with appropriate action or helpful comments.\", 'Chatbots perform the same magic in response to typed text entries.', 'The best of these also learn to recognize contextual clues about human requests and use them to provide even better responses or options over time.', 'The next enhancement for these applications is question answering, the ability to respond to our questions—anticipated or not—with relevant and helpful answers in their own words.', 'Social media sentiment analysis: NLP has become an essential business tool for uncovering hidden data insights from social media channels.', 'Sentiment analysis can analyze language used in social media posts, responses, reviews, and more to extract attitudes and emotions in response to products, promotions, and events–information companies can use in product designs, advertising campaigns, and more.', \"Text summarization: Text

the sentiment, or emotion behind a text.', 'For example, when brand A is mentioned in X number of texts, the algorithm can determine how many of those mentions were positive and how many were negative.', 'It can also be useful for intent detection, which helps predict what the speaker or writer may do based on the text they are producing.', 'Text extraction.', 'This involves automatically summarizing text and finding important pieces of data.', 'One example of this is keyword extraction, which pulls the most important words from the text, which can be useful for search engine optimization.', 'Doing this with natural language processing requires some programming -- it is not completely automated.', 'However, there are plenty of simple keyword extraction tools that automate most of the process -- the user just has to set parameters within the program.', 'For example, a tool might pull out the most frequently used words in the text.', 'Another example is named entity recognition, which extracts the names of people, places and other entities from text.', 'Machine translation.', 'This is the process by which a computer translates text from one language, such as English, to another language, such as French, without human intervention.', 'Natural language generation.', 'This involves using natural language processing algorithms to analyze unstructured data and automatically produce content based on that data.', 'One example of this is in language models such as GPT3, which are able to analyze an unstructured text and then generate believable articles based on the text.', 'The functions listed above are used in a variety of real-world applications, including:', 'customer feedback analysis -- where AI analyzes social media reviews;', 'customer service automation -- where voice assistants on the other end of a customer service phone line are able to use speech recognition to understand what the customer is saying, so that it can direct the call correctly;', 'automatic translation -- using tools such as Google Translate, Bing Translator and Translate Me;', 'academic research and analysis -- where AI is able to analyze huge amounts of academic material and research papers not just based on the metadata of the text, but the text itself;', 'analysis and categorization of medical records -- where AI uses insights to predict, and ideally prevent, disease;', 'word processors used for plagiarism and proofreading -- using tools such as Grammarly and Microsoft Word;', \"stock forecasting and insights into financial trading -- using AI to analyze market history and 10-K documents, which contain comprehensive summaries about a company's financial performance;\", 'talent recruitment in human resources; and', 'automation of routine litigation tasks -- one example is the artificially intelligent attorney.', 'Research being done on natural language processing revolves around search, especially Enterprise search.', 'This involves having users query data sets in the form of a question that they might pose to another person.', 'The machine interprets the important elements of the human language sentence, which correspond to specific features in a data set, and returns an answer.', 'NLP can be used to interpret free, unstructured text and make it analyzable.', \"There is a tremendous amount of information stored in free text files, such as patients' medical records.\", 'Before deep learning-based NLP models, this information was inaccessible to computer-assisted analysis and could not be analyzed in any systematic way.', 'With NLP analysts can sift through massive amounts of free text to find relevant information.', 'Sentiment analysis is another primary use case for NLP.', \"Using sentiment analysis, data scientists can assess comments on social media to see how their business's brand is performing, or review notes from customer service teams to identify areas where people want the business to perform better.\", 'Benefits of natural language processing', 'The main benefit of NLP is that it improves the way humans and computers communicate with each other.', \"The most direct way to manipulate a computer is through code -- the computer's language.\", 'By enabling computers to understand human language, interacting with computers becomes much more intuitive for humans.', 'Other benefits include:', 'improved accuracy and efficiency of documentation;', 'ability to automatically make a readable summary of a larger, more complex original text;', 'useful for personal assistants such as Alexa, by enabling it to understand spoken word;', 'enables an organization to use chatbots for customer support;', 'easier to perform sentiment analysis; and', 'provides advanced insights from analytics that were previously unreachable due to data volume.', 'Challenges of natural language processing', 'There are a number of challenges of natural language processing and most of them boil down to the fact that natural language is ever-evolving and always somewhat ambiguous.', 'They include:', 'Precision.', 'Computers traditionally require humans to \"speak\" to them in a programming language that is precise, unambiguous and highly structured -- or through a limited number of clearly enunciated voice commands.', 'Human speech, however, is not always precise; it is often ambiguous and the linguistic structure can depend on many complex variables, including slang, regional dialects and social context.', 'Tone of voice and inflection.', 'Natural language processing has not yet been perfected.', 'For example, semantic analysis can still be a challenge.', 'Other difficulties include the fact that the abstract use of language is typically tricky for programs to understand.', 'For instance, natural language processing does not pick up sarcasm easily.', 'These topics usually require understanding the words being used and their context in a conversation.', 'As another example, a sentence can change meaning depending on which word or syllable the speaker puts stress on.', \"NLP algorithms may miss the subtle, but important, tone changes in a person's voice when performing speech recognition.\", 'The tone and inflection of speech may also vary between different accents, which can be challenging for an algorithm to parse.', 'Evolving use of language.', 'Natural language processing is also challenged by the fact that language -- and the way people use it -- is continually changing.', 'Although there are rules to language, none are written in stone, and they are subject to change over time.', 'Hard computational rules that work now may become obsolete as the characteristics of real-world language change over time.', 'The evolution of natural language processing', 'NLP draws from a variety of disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics developments dating back to the mid-20th century.', 'Its evolution included the following major milestones:', '1950s.', 'Natural language processing has its roots in this decade, when Alan Turing developed the Turing Test to determine whether or not a computer is truly intelligent.', 'The test involves automated interpretation and the generation of natural language as criterion of intelligence.', '1950s-1990s.', 'NLP was largely rules-based, using handcrafted rules developed by linguists to determine how computers would process language.', '1990s.', 'The top-down, language-first approach to natural language processing was replaced with a more statistical approach, because advancements in computing made this a more efficient way of developing NLP technology.', 'Computers were becoming faster and could be used to develop rules based on linguistic statistics without a linguist creating all of the rules.', 'Data-driven natural language processing became mainstream during this decade.', 'Natural language processing shifted from a linguist-based approach to an engineer-based approach, drawing on a wider variety of scientific disciplines instead of delving into linguistics.', '2000-2020s.', 'Natural language processing saw dramatic growth in popularity as a term.', 'With advances in computing power, natural language processing has also gained numerous real-world applications.', 'Today, approaches to NLP involve a combination of classical linguistics and statistical methods.', 'Natural language processing plays a vital part in technology and the way humans interact with it.', 'It is used in many real-world applications in both the business and consumer spheres, including chatbots, cybersecurity, search engines and big data analytics.', 'Though not without its challenges, NLP is expected to continue to be an important part of both industry and everyday life.', 'Although there are doubts, natural language processing is making significant strides in the medical imaging field.', 'Learn how radiologists are using AI and NLP in

            "['Towards Data Science', 'Jan 15, 2019', 'Save', 'Your Guide to Natural Language Processing (NLP)', 'How machines process and understand human language', 'Everything we express (either verbally or in written) carries huge amounts of information.', 'The topic we choose, our tone, our selection of words, everything adds some type of information that can be interpreted and value extracted from it.', 'In theory, we can understand and even predict human behaviour using that information.', 'But there is a problem: one person may generate hundreds or thousands of words in a declaration, each sentence with its corresponding complexity.', 'If you want to scale and analyze several hundreds, thousands or millions of people or declarations in a given geography, then the situation is unmanageable.', 'Data generated from conversations, declarations or even tweets are examples of unstructured data.', 'Unstructured data doesn’t fit neatly into the traditional row and column structure of relational databases, and represent the vast majority of data available in the actual world.', 'It is messy and hard to manipulate.', 'Nevertheless, thanks to the advances in disciplines like machine learning a big revolution is going on regarding this topic.', 'Nowadays it is no longer about trying to interpret a text or speech based on its keywords (the old fashioned mechanical way), but about understanding the meaning behind those words (the cognitive way).', 'This way it is possible to detect figures of speech like irony, or even perform sentiment analysis.', 'Natural Language Processing or NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence that gives the machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages.', 'It is a discipline that focuses on the interaction between data science and human language, and is scaling to lots of industries.', 'Today NLP is booming thanks to the huge improvements in the access to data and the increase in computational power, which are allowing practitioners to achieve meaningful results in areas like healthcare, media, finance and human resources, among others.', 'Use Cases of NLP', 'In simple terms, NLP represents the automatic handling of natural human language like speech or text, and although the concept itself is fascinating, the real value behind this technology comes from the use cases.', 'NLP can help you with lots of tasks and the fields of application just seem to increase on a daily basis.', 'Let’s mention some examples:', 'NLP enables the recognition and prediction of diseases based on electronic health records and patient’s own speech.', 'This capability is being explored in health conditions that go from cardiovascular diseases to depression and even schizophrenia.', 'For example, Amazon Comprehend Medical is a service that uses NLP to extract disease conditions, medications and treatment outcomes from patient notes, clinical trial reports and other electronic health records.', 'Organizations can determine what customers are saying about a service or product by identifying and extracting information in sources like social media.', 'This sentiment analysis can provide a lot of information about customers choices and their decision drivers.', 'An inventor at IBM developed a cognitive assistant that works like a personalized search engine by learning all about you and then remind you of a name, a song, or anything you can’t remember the moment you need it to.', 'Companies like Yahoo and Google filter and classify your emails with NLP by analyzing text in emails that flow through their servers and stopping spam before they even enter your inbox.', 'To help identifying fake news, the NLP Group at MIT developed a new system to determine if a source is accurate or politically biased, detecting if a news source can be trusted or not.', 'Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri are examples of intelligent voice driven interfaces that use NLP to respond to vocal prompts and do everything like find a particular shop, tell us the weather forecast, suggest the best route to the office or turn on the lights at home.', 'Having an insight into what is happening and what people are talking about can be very valuable to financial traders.', 'NLP is being used to track news, reports, comments about possible mergers between companies, everything can be then incorporated into a trading algorithm to generate massive profits.', 'Remember: buy the rumor, sell the news.', 'NLP is also being used in both the search and selection phases of talent recruitment, identifying the skills of potential hires and also spotting prospects before they become active on the job market.', 'Powered by IBM Watson NLP technology, LegalMation developed a platform to automate routine litigation tasks and help legal teams save time, drive down costs and shift strategic focus.', 'NLP is particularly booming in the healthcare industry.', 'This technology is improving care delivery, disease diagnosis and bringing costs down while healthcare organizations are going through a growing adoption of electronic health records.', 'The fact that clinical documentation can be improved means that patients can be better understood and benefited through better healthcare.', 'The goal should be to optimize their experience, and several organizations are already working on this.', 'Companies like Winterlight Labs are making huge improvements in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease by monitoring cognitive impairment through speech and they can also support clinical trials and studies for a wide range of central nervous system disorders.', 'Following a similar approach, Stanford University developed Woebot, a chatbot therapist with the aim of helping people with anxiety and other disorders.', 'But serious controversy is around the subject.', 'A couple of years ago Microsoft demonstrated that by analyzing large samples of search engine queries, they could identify internet users who were suffering from pancreatic cancer even before they have received a diagnosis of the disease.', 'How would users react to such diagnosis?', 'And what would happen if you were tested as a false positive?', '(meaning that you can be diagnosed with the disease even though you don’t have it).', 'This recalls the case of Google Flu Trends which in 2009 was announced as being able to predict influenza but later on vanished due to its low accuracy and inability to meet its projected rates.', 'NLP may be the key to an effective clinical support in the future, but there are still many challenges to face in the short term.', 'Basic NLP to impress your non-NLP friends', 'The main drawbacks we face these days with NLP relate to the fact that language is very tricky.', 'The process of understanding and manipulating language is extremely complex, and for this reason it is common to use different techniques to handle different challenges before binding everything together.', 'Programming languages like Python or R are highly used to perform these techniques, but before diving into code lines (that will be the topic of a different article), it’s important to understand the concepts beneath them.', 'Let’s summarize and explain some of the most frequently used algorithms in NLP when defining the vocabulary of terms:', 'Bag of Words', 'Is a commonly used model that allows you to count all words in a piece of text.', 'Basically it creates an occurrence matrix for the sentence or document, disregarding grammar and word order.', 'These word frequencies or occurrences are then used as features for training a classifier.', 'To bring a short example I took the first sentence of the song “Across the Universe” from The Beatles:', 'Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,', 'They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe', 'Now let’s count the words:', 'This approach may reflect several downsides like the absence of semantic meaning and context, and the facts that stop words (like “the” or “a”) add noise to the analysis and some words are not weighted accordingly (“universe” weights less than the word “they”).', 'To solve this problem, one approach is to rescale the frequency of words by how often they appear in all texts (not just the one we are analyzing) so that the scores for frequent words like “the”, that are also frequent across other texts, get penalized.', 'This approach to scoring is called “Term Frequency — Inverse Document Frequency” (TFIDF), and improves the bag of words by weights.', 'Through TFIDF frequent terms in the text are “rewarded” (like the word “they” in our example), but they also get “punished” if those terms are frequent in other texts we include in the algorithm too.', 'On the contrary, this method highlights and “rewards” unique or rare terms considering all texts.', 'Nevertheless, this approach still has no context nor semantics.', 'Tokenization', 'Is the process of segmenting running text into sentences and words.', 'In essence, it’s the task of cutting a text into pieces called tokens, and at the same time throwing away certain characters, such as punctuation.', 'Following our example, the result of tokenization would be:', 'Pretty simple, right?', 'Well, although it may seem quite basic in this case and also in languages like English that separate words by a blank space (called segmented languages) not all languages behave the same, and if you think about it, blank spaces alone are not sufficient enough even for English to perform proper tokenizations.', 'Splitting on blank spaces may break up what should be considered as one token, as in the case of certain names (e.g. San Francisco or New York) or borrowed foreign phrases (e.g. laissez faire).', 'Tokenization can remove punctuation too, easing the path to a proper word segmentation but also triggering possible complications.', 'In the case of periods that follow abbreviation (e.g. dr.), the period following that abbreviation should be considered as part of the same token and not be removed.', 'The tokenization process can be particularly problematic when dealing with biomedical text domains which contain lots of hyphens, parentheses, and other punctuation marks.', 'For deeper details on tokenization, you can find a great explanation in this article.', 'Stop Words Removal', 'Includes getting rid of common language articles, pronouns and prepositions such as “and”, “the” or “to” in English.', 'In this process some very common words that appear to provide little or no value to the NLP objective are filtered and excluded from the text to be processed, hence removing widespread and frequent terms that are not informative about the corresponding text.', 'Stop words can be safely ignored by carrying out a lookup in a pre-defined list of keywords, freeing up database space and improving processing time.', 'There is no universal list of stop words.', 'These can be pre-selected or built from scratch.', 'A potential approach is to begin by adopting pre-defined stop words and add words to the list later on.', 'Nevertheless it seems that the general trend over the past time has been to go from the use of large standard stop word lists to the use of no lists at all.', 'The thing is stop words removal can wipe out relevant information and modify the context in a given sentence.', 'For example, if we are performing a sentiment analysis we might throw our algorithm off track if we remove a stop word like “not”.', 'Under these conditions, you might select a minimal stop word list and add additional terms depending on your specific objective.', 'Stemming', 'Refers to the process of slicing the end or the beginning of words with the intention of removing affixes (lexical additions to the root of the word).', 'Affixes that are attached at the beginning of the word are called prefixes (e.g. “astro” in the word “astrobiology”) and the ones attached at the end of the word are called suffixes (e.g. “ful” in the word “helpful”).', 'The problem is that affixes can create or expand new forms of the same word (called inflectional affixes), or even create new words themselves (called derivational affixes).', 'In English, prefixes are always derivational (the affix creates a new word as in the example of the prefix “eco” in the word “ecosystem”), but suffixes can be derivational (the affix creates a new word as in the example of the suffix “ist” in the word “guitarist”) or inflectional (the affix creates a new form of word as in the example of the suffix “er” in the word “faster”).', 'Ok, so how can we tell the difference and chop the right bit?', 'A possible approach is to consider a list of common affixes and rules (Python and R languages have different libraries containing affixes and methods) and perform stemming based on them, but of course this approach presents limitations.', 'Since stemmers use algorithmics approaches, the result of the stemming process may not be an actual word or even change the word (and sentence) meaning.', 'To offset this effect you can edit those predefined methods by adding or removing affixes and rules, but you must consider that you might be improving the performance in one area while producing a degradation in another one.', 'Always look at the whole picture and test your model’s performance.', 'So if stemming has serious limitations, why do we use it?', 'First of all, it can be used to correct spelling errors from the tokens.', 'Stemmers are simple to use and run very fast (they perform simple operations on a string), and if speed and performance are important in the NLP model, then stemming is certainly the way to go.', 'Remember, we use it with the objective of improving our performance, not as a grammar exercise.', 'Lemmatization', 'Has the objective of reducing a word to its base form and grouping together different forms of the same word.', 'For example, verbs in past tense are changed into present (e.g. “went” is changed to “go”) and synonyms are unified (e.g. “best” is changed to “good”), hence standardizing words with similar meaning to their root.', 'Although it seems closely related to the stemming process, lemmatization uses a different approach to reach the root forms of words.', 'Lemmatization resolves words to their dictionary form (known as lemma) for which it requires detailed dictionaries in which the algorithm can look into and link words to their corresponding lemmas.', 'For example, the words “running”, “runs” and “ran” are all forms of the word “run”, so “run” is the lemma of all the previous words.', 'Lemmatization also takes into consideration the context of the word in order to solve other problems like disambiguation, which means it can discriminate between identical words that have different meanings depending on the specific context.', 'Think about words like “bat” (which can correspond to the animal or to the metal/wooden club used in baseball) or “bank” (corresponding to the financial institution or to the land alongside a body of water).', 'By providing a part-of-speech parameter to a word ( whether it is a noun, a verb, and so on) it’s possible to define a role for that word in the sentence and remove disambiguation.', 'As you might already pictured, lemmatization is a much more resource-intensive task than performing a stemming process.', 'At the same time, since it requires more knowledge about the language structure than a stemming approach, it demands more computational power than setting up or adapting a stemming algorithm.', 'Topic Modeling', 'Is as a method for uncovering hidden structures in sets of texts or documents.', 'In essence it clusters texts to discover latent topics based on their contents, processing individual words and assigning them values based on their distribution.', 'This technique is based on the assumptions that each document consists of a mixture of topics and that each topic consists of a set of words, which means that if we can spot these hidden topics we can unlock the meaning of our texts.', 'From the universe of topic modelling techniques, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is probably the most commonly used.', 'This relatively new algorithm (invented less than 20 years ago) works as an unsupervised learning method that discovers different topics underlying a collection of documents.', 'In unsupervised learning methods like this one, there is no output variable to guide the learning process and data is explored by algorithms to find patterns.', 'To be more specific, LDA finds groups of related words by:', 'Assigning each word to a random topic, where the user defines the number of topics it wishes to uncover.', 'You don’t define the topics themselves (you define just the number of topics) and the algorithm will map all documents to the topics in a way that words in each document are mostly captured by those imaginary topics.', 'The algorithm goes through each word iteratively and reassigns the word to a topic taking into considerations the probability that the word belongs to a topic, and the probability that the document will be generated by a topic.', 'These probabilities are calculated multiple times, until the convergence of the algorithm.', 'Unlike other clustering algorithms like K-means that perform hard clustering (where topics are disjointed), LDA assigns each document to a mixture of topics, which means that each document can be described by one or more topics (e.g. Document 1 is described by 70% of topic A, 20% of topic B and 10% of topic C) and reflect more realistic results.', 'Topic modeling is extremely useful for classifying texts, building recommender systems (e.g. to recommend you books based on your past readings) or even detecting trends in online publications.', 'How does the future look like?', 'At the moment NLP is battling to detect nuances in language meaning, whether due to lack of context, spelling errors or dialectal differences.', 'On March 2016 Microsoft launched Tay, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot released on Twitter as a NLP experiment.', 'The idea was that as more users conversed with Tay, the smarter it would get.', 'Well, the result was that after 16 hours Tay had to be removed due to its racist and abusive comments:', 'Microsoft learnt from its own experience and some months later released Zo, its second generation English-language chatbot that won’t be caught making the same mistakes as its predecessor.', 'Zo uses a combination of innovative approaches to recognize and generate conversation, and other companies are exploring with bots that can remember details specific to an individual conversation.', 'Although the future looks extremely challenging and full of threats for NLP, the discipline is developing at a very fast pace (probably like never before) and we are likely to reach a level of advancement in the coming years that will make complex applications look possible.', 'Thanks Jesús del Valle , Jannis Busch and
